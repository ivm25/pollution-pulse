# Air Pollution Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast air pollution levels in New South Wales (NSW) using Python for data analysis and Python Shiny for creating an interactive user interface. The project will utilize `sktime` and `pytimetk` for time series forecasting and machine learning in the near future.

## Features
- Interactive dashboard for visualizing air pollution data using **Python Shiny**.
- Analysis of air pollution trends across various locations in NSW.
- Visualization of key pollutants over time.
- Integration of `sktime` and `pytimetk` for advanced forecasting and machine learning models (coming soon).

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:


<!-- The dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. -->

## Data Sources
The air pollution data used in this project is sourced from official NSW government databases and other reliable sources. Detailed information about data collection and preprocessing can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Future Work
- **Forecasting**: Implement time series forecasting using `sktime` and `pytimetk` to predict future pollution levels.
- **Machine Learning**: Develop machine learning models to identify patterns and anomalies in the pollution data.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more interactive visualizations and insights to the dashboard.
